# @consolia-io/ui
> Consolia UI is a React component library styled with Stitches, primarily designed for Next.js but adaptable to other React applications. We use it extensively in our projects, particularly customized to suit our specific needs.
\
\
> We've open-sourced it in the hopes that it may be helpful to other startups and developers. Please keep in mind that it's not intended for general-purpose use or production outside of Consolia projects.

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Usage

To work on components in the browser, run the development server and make changes in the `playground` directory.

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Before you deploy, lint your code and format it. Then run the build script to generate the production bundle.

```sh
pnpm tidy
pnpm build
```
